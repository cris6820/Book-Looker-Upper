# Book Search Engine Starter Code

Deployed heroku webpage: https://book-looker-upper.herokuapp.com/ 
AS AN avid reader
I WANT to search for new books to read
SO THAT I can keep a list of books to purchase


GIVEN a book search engine
WHEN I load the search engine
THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button

â¬† Is supposed to be the pages functionality.
